In this post, I will share my notes for the Big Data Analytics course chapter three which is Finding Similar Items. A fundamental data-mining problem is to examine data for “similar” items. There are three essential techniques to find similar documents. They are:

Shingling:
Find textually similar documents by finding sets with a relatively large document.

Minhashing:
Compress data sets to short signatures(list of integers) and still be able to deduce the similarity of the underlying sets. 

Locality sensitive hashing:
Focus search on pairs that are most likely to be similar.

the similarity of sets by looking at the relative size of their intersection is called “Jaccard similarity.

Applications of Near-Neighbor Search

Jaccard Similarity of Sets
The Jaccard similarity of sets S and T is |S ∩ T |/|S ∪ T |, that is, the ratio of the size of the intersection of S and T to the size of their union. We shall denote the Jaccard similarity of S and T by SIM(S, T ).

Similarity of Documents
The aspect of similarity we are looking at here is character-level similarity, not “similar meaning,” which requires us to examine the words in the documents and their uses.

Some examples of near-neighbor search Plagiarism, Mirror Pages, Articles from the Same Source

Collaborative Filtering as a Similar-Sets Problem
A process whereby we recommend to users items that were liked by other users who have exhibited similar tastes.

The Jaccard similarity for bags B and C is defined by counting an element n times in the intersection if n is the minimum of the number of times the element appears in B and C. In the union, we count the element the sum of the number of times it appears in B and in C.

The bag-similarity of bags {a, a, a, b} and {a, a, b, b, c} is 1/3. The intersection counts a twice and b once, so its size is 3. The size of the union of two bags is always the sum of the sizes of the two bags, or 9 in this case.

Compute the Jaccard similarities of each pair of the following three sets: {1, 2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5, 7}, and {2, 4, 6}.

1 & 2 = {2, 3} / {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7} = 2 / 6

2 & 3 = {2} / {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} = 1 / 6

1 & 3 = {2, 4} / {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} = 2 / 5

Compute the Jaccard bag similarity of each pair of the following three bags: {1, 1, 1, 2}, {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, and {1, 2, 3, 4}

1 & 2 = {1, 1, 2} / {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3} = 3 / 9

2 & 3 = {1, 2, 3} / {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4} = 3 / 9

1 & 3 = {1, 2} / {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4} = 2 / 8


Shingling of Documents

k-Shingles
Suppose our document D is the string abcdabd, and we pick k = 2. Then the set of 2-shingles for D is {ab, bc, cd, da, bd}
Note that the substring ab appears twice within D, but appears only once as a shingle. A variation of shingling produces a bag, rather than a set, so each shingle would appear in the result as many times as it appears in the document. However, we shall not use bags of shingles here.

white space (blank, tab, newline, etc.) is treated to replace any sequence of one or more white-space characters by a single blank.

Choosing the Shingle Size
If k is too small most sequences of k characters to appear in most documents. 
k should be picked large enough that the probability of any given shingle appearing in any given document is low.
For e-mails k = 5 is selected and this means 14,348,907 possible shingles. An e mail includes much more less than this value. A good rule of thumb says consider character number as 20 and so thath 20^5. For large documents as research articles k = 9 is considered as safe.

Matrix Representation of Sets
Characteristic matrix: The columns of the matrix correspond to the sets, and the rows correspond to elements of the universal set from which elements of the sets are drawn. There is a 1 in row r and column c if the element for row r is a member of the set for column c. Otherwise the value in position (r, c) is 0.

Minhashing

To minhash a set represented by a column of the characteristic matrix, pick a permutation of the rows. The minhash value of any column is the number of the first row, in the permuted order, in which the column has a 1.

Minhashing and Jaccard Similarity
There is a remarkable connection between minhashing and Jaccard similarity
of the sets that are minhashed.

• The probability that the minhash function for a random permutation of
rows produces the same value for two sets equals the Jaccard similarity
of those sets.

Locality-Sensitive Hashing

We can calculate the probability that these
documents (or rather their signatures) become a candidate pair as follows:
1. The probability that the signatures agree in all rows of one particular
band is s^r.
2. The probability that the signatures disagree in at least one row of a particular
band is 1 − s^r.
3. The probability that the signatures disagree in at least one row of each
of the bands is (1 − s^r)^b.
4. The probability that the signatures agree in all the rows of at least one
band, and therefore become a candidate pair, is 1 − (1 − s^r)^b.


Distance Measures:
Euclidean Distances

Jaccard Distance
d(x, y) = 1 − SIM(x, y).

Cosine Distance
Let our two vectors be x = [1, 2,−1] and = [2, 1, 1]. The dot
product x.y is 1 × 2 + 2 × 1 + (−1) × 1 = 3. The L2-norm of both vectors is √6. For example, x has L2-norm p12 + 22 + (−1)2 = √6. Thus, the cosine of
the angle between x and y is 3/(√6√6) or 1/2. The angle whose cosine is 1/2
is 60 degrees, so that is the cosine distance between x and y.


Edit Distance
This distance makes sense when points are strings. The distance between two
strings x = x1x2 · · · xn and y = y1y2 · · · ym is the smallest number of insertions
and deletions of single characters that will convert x to y.

This is the apriori property: any subset of frequent itemset must be frequent. 
So if you know at level 2 that the sets {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,5} and {3,5} are the only sets with sufficient support, then at level 
3 you join these with each other to produce {1,2,3}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,5} and {2,3,5} but you need only consider {1,3,5} further: 
the others each have subsets with insufficent support (such as {2,3} or {2,5} ).
