I am reading Cracking The Coding Interview book again and there is a table that every one should know at basics. Today I am talking about them in a very basic manner.

Data Structures		        Algorithms		              Concepts
Linked Lists		           Breadth First Search		    Bit Manipulation
Binary Trees		           Depth First Search		      Singleton Design Pattern
Tries		                  Binary Search		           Factory Design Pattern
Stacks		                 Merge Sort		              Memory (Stack vs Heap)
Queues		                 Quick Sort		              Recursion
Vectors / ArrayLists		   Tree Insert / Find / etc		Big-O Time
Hash Tables
