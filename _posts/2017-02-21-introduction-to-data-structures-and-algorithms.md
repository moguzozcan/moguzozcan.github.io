In this post, I'll talk about the DS and Algorithms topic in general. These topics are the core of the "Computer Science", so they need to
be learn carefully. DS effects memory and algorithm effects the CPU of the machine, so choosing the right DS and algorithm is critical
in overall performance. There is a tradeoff between the memory and CPU time. So, choosing the best is not an easy job.  

Data Structure: A sistematic way of organizing and storing data in an efficient way.

  Correctness:
  Time Complexity:
  Space Complexity:
  
Why need DS:
  Searching faster:
  Handle multiple requests:
  Limited processor:
  
  Worst Case:
  Average Case:
  Best Case:
  
Algorithms:
