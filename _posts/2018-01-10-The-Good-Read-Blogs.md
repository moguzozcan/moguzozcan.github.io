This is the first post of 2018. I have created a tracker for myself, where I am planning to plan my life in weekly manner. One of my tracker
is to write at least one post each week. In this I am planning to store the good blog writings about my job, software engineering. This 
post has to be a living post. The first blogs that I've currently read are:
