Lately, I came accross with the CAP Theorem a few times so I want to read and learn about it. CAP states for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance and this theorem states that in a distributed system, these three cannot exist in the same time. At least one of them has to be sacrificied to have the others. Let's explain them one by one to understand the reasoning. The [2] is one of the best resource that explains this in plain English. 

1. Consistency


2. Availability 
3. Partition Tolerance
