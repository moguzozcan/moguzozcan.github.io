I am 30 years old developer and this is the first blog post I have ever written and I don't take it as a shame.  

Plan is to share some notes and personal experiences here, mostly technical and related to software development, but who knows what other experiences life will bring that I will want to share. 

> This blog is written on jekyll based on Minimal Mistakes template. Checkout the footer at the bottom for the reference.
