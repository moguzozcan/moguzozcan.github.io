Hi guys, 
In this post I will review the BT and BST topics. I've seen this problem in the Cracking the Coding Interview  
<a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree"> Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?</a> link. 

Now, binary tree is a tree data structure, where each node might have at most two child nodes called left and right. Height of the tree
is calculated recursively as: height(t) = 1 + max(height(root.left), height(root.right))

Whereas, a binary search tree aka  ordered or sorted binary trees, is a special kind of binary tree, where all the nodes in left of a node is <= ancestor and all the nodes
in the right of a node is > value of the node itself. Advantage of the BST is that, since it has a special way of storing elements, sorting
is very fast. You only need to compare two child nodes and according to result you eliminate half of the tree. Inserting or searching 
a balanced bst is O(log(n)). Whereas, the bst can easily became unbalanced according to the insertion order. This makes inserting and 
sorting complexity to O(n).

Another important topic in trees is tree traversal. There are four types of traversing the trees:

1. InOrder Traversal: Generally we want this traversal, since it gives the correct order. 
left-root-right order

2. PostOrder Traversal:
left-right-root order

3. PreOrder Traversal: as deeply to the left as possible, it's also known as a depth-first-search or DFS
root-left-right order

4. Level Order Traversal: A level-order traversal of tree  is an algorithm that processes the root, followed by the children of the 
root (from left to right), followed by the grandchildren of the root (from left to right)
 breadth-first-search (BFS)
 
      4
  2       6
1   3   5   7  
The binary tree above has the following traversals:

InOrder: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
PostOrder: 1 3 2 5 7 6 4
PreOrder: 4 2 1 3 6 5 7
Level-Order: 4 2 6 1 3 5 7

Now, let's go to the solution of the problem. How to detect if a given binary tree is a binary search tree? The first solution that comes to my mind is the following. First check if the root node is null, if null return true. Then check if the data of left node is
bigger than the root and if yes result is false. The opposite is valid for right node. If the data of right node is smaller or equal than the root node, then result is false. At last, we are 'AND'ing two results and we are using recursive approach to call same function for left and right child nodes. This code is not able to pass 6 test cases. Why?

```java
boolean checkBST(Node root) {
    boolean leftRes = true;
    boolean rigthRes = true;

    if(root == null)
        return true;

    if(root.left != null) {
        if(root.left.data >= root.data) {
            leftRes = false;
        } else {
            leftRes = true;
        }
    } else {
        return true;
    }

    if(root.right != null) {
        if(root.right.data <= root.data) {
            rigthRes = false;
        } else {
            rigthRes = true;
        }
    } else {
        return true;
    }

    return leftRes && rigthRes && checkBST(root.left) && checkBST(root.right);         
}
```

The above code only checks whether the value of the left node is smaller then its root or the value of right is bigger then its own root. However, if any data which is a left child of a node has value bigger then its ancestors, then the tree is not a BST. In the above code this check does not exist. By putting these two checks, we make sure that all the left child nodes have data that is less than the ancestors and all the right child nodes have data that is more than its ancestors data. 

```java
boolean checkBST(Node root) {
    return check(root,Integer.MIN_VALUE,Integer.MAX_VALUE);
}
boolean check(Node n, int min, int max){
    if(n==null)
        return true;
    if(n.data <= min || n.data >= max)
        return false;
    return check(n.left, min, n.data) 
        && check(n.right, n.data, max);
}
```
