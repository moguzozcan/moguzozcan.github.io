I am planning to make a PhD in Machine Learning if I will get accepted of course :) Therefore, these days I am planning to be attached to
TensorFlow. Firstly, I need to install it and I will follow the official documentation for this, which is 'https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started'. Firstly, I need to install Python 3.5.2 and add it to path. By the way, I am using
Windows 8.1. 

```
C:\Users\oguz>python --version
Python 3.5.2
```

I learned that there are two versions of TensorFlow, from now on I will refer TensorFlow as TF since it is long to write everytime :). 
First one is using GPU and second one is with CPU. For the beginning CPU version is preferred, therefore I will install this version with
the following command 'pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow'. Actually, at the beginning I was planning to use my company computer but, 
there occured so many proxy issues and I moved back to my PC. 

I successfully installed it, at the end it gave me a warning that 'You are using pip version 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command.'
