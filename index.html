        <h1>Hi there, I'm Oğuz!</h1>
		<p>I'm a software engineer works at <em>Siemens</em>. For a very long time I was thinking about
			creating a personal website, where I can share my thoughts and share the stuff that I learn throughout 
			my career. After some search about the platform, I decided to use github's github pages. I provides 
			all the things that I want, a website, blog etc.

		<p>Currently, I am studying the Java certification exam of the Oracle. As you might know, there are two exams,
			where the first one is the prequisite to the other. The first exam is the "Oracle Certified Java Associate",
			OCA in short. The second one is "Oracle Certified Java Professional", OCP in short. I am preparing for
			Java 8, which is currently latest version of the Java. You can find more information about the 
			certification process in here.
